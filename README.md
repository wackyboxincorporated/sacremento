a visualization webapp that does two things: play a song, and attempt to time a visualiser with it.
the timing is usually correct within a few dozen milliseconds but any stutter or lag will make the sync a lot worse.
when the song ends, it doesn't loop, so the visualiser will no longer make any attempt to correct itself and will infinitely produce the effect at the same timing.
